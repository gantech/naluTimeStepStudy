Nalu-Wind Time Step study for RANS applications
===============================================


The objective of this work is to modify any part of Nalu-Wind to make the results independent of the time step for RANS applications. "RANS applications" refer to RANS simulations of flow past aerodynamic objects like airfoils, wings and wind turbine blades at Reynolds numbers greater than :math:`10^6`.
